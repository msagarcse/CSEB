JavaScript does not have "methods" in the form that 
class-based languages define them. In JavaScript, any function

Any inherited function acts just as any other property, 
including property shadowing


When an inherited function is executed, the value of "this" 
points to the inheriting object, not to the prototype object 
where the function is an own property.
