/*
The context object, this is a dynamic object which
is set dynamically depending on the way a function
is called. There are several rules to follow in order
to figure out what this is bound to.
*/

/*
The purpose of the new keyword is to invoke a function 
as a constructor of objects.

When a function is called with the new keyword,
couple of things happen behind the scenes:

-> A new empty object is created
-> The context object this is bound to the new empty object
-> The new object is linked to the functionâ€™s prototype property
-> "this" is automatically returned unless another non-primitive 
	value is returned explicitly from the function

This is the mechanism provided by JavaScript to link objects with 
prototype objects.

These functions are known as constructor functions.
